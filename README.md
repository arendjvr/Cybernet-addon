# Cybernet-addon
A rimworld mod which expands on the Cybernet mod

It expands by adding networked organs and special implants such as:

<h2>Vanilla parts:</h2>

Networked Lungs

Networked Kidneys

Networked Liver

Pain Regulator (reduces pain by a flat offset)



<h2>Royalty parts:</h2>

Networked coagulator & healing enhancer

Flesh Adapter (increases beauty)

Panzer Skin Gland (still needs some balancing)

<h1>Plans for the future:</h1>

Royalty inspired implants

More brain impants

Replacement bodyparts that have a more specific function (pain inducer, mood, etc.)

More parts like lymphatic nodes

Implants related to other mods 

More custom Stats (once i learn C#)
